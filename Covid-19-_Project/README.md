# COVID-19 Patient Outcome Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes a **COVID-19 dataset** provided by the Mexican government. The dataset contains **1,048,576 anonymized patient records** with **21 unique features** related to patient demographics, pre-existing conditions, and medical interventions. The goal of this project is to build a **predictive model** that classifies patients based on their COVID-19 test findings.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: Mexican government ([Insert Dataset Link])
- **Number of Records**: 1,048,576 patients
- **Number of Features**: 21

### Features Description

- **sex**: 1 (Female), 2 (Male)
- **age**: Age of the patient
- **classification**: COVID test results (1-3: Positive, 4+: Negative/Inconclusive)
- **patient\_type**: 1 (Returned home), 2 (Hospitalized)
- **pneumonia**: Presence of pneumonia (1: Yes, 2: No)
- **pregnancy**: Pregnancy status (1: Yes, 2: No, 97: All men, 98: Missing)
- **diabetes, copd, asthma, inmsupr, hypertension, cardiovascular, renal\_chronic, other\_disease, obesity, tobacco**: Presence of pre-existing conditions (1: Yes, 2: No)
- **usmr**: Type of medical facility
- **medical\_unit**: Institution providing care
- **intubed**: If the patient was placed on a ventilator (1: Yes, 2: No, 97: Returned home, 99: Missing)
- **icu**: ICU admission (1: Yes, 2: No, 97: Returned home, 99: Missing)
- **date\_died**: Date of death (9999-99-99: Patient survived)

## Data Analysis & Preprocessing

After a detailed data inspection, the following issues were identified and handled:

1. **Incorrect missing value representation**:

   - Only **97** represents missing data in most features (except Pregnancy, where **98** is missing data).
   - Features with missing values: `intubed`, `pregnant`, `icu`

2. **Data Correction for INTUBED and ICU**:

   - **Patients who returned home (patient\_type = 1) cannot be in ICU or intubated.**
   - Therefore, **97 values in ICU and INTUBED were replaced with 2 (No)**.
   - **99 values in ICU and INTUBED were treated as missing data.**

3. **Encoding & Feature Engineering**:

   - One-hot encoding for categorical features.
   - Imputed missing values using an **iterative imputer**.
   - Scaled numerical features.

## Model Training & Evaluation

A classification model was trained to predict COVID-19 outcomes.

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 94.70%

#### Confusion Matrix

 [  6989   8251]]
```

#### Classification Report

           1       0.67      0.54      0.60     15240

    accuracy                           0.95    209715
   macro avg       0.82      0.76      0.78    209715
weighted avg       0.94      0.95      0.94    209715
```

- **High accuracy (94.70%)** indicates a well-performing model.
- **Class imbalance observed** (COVID-negative patients dominate the dataset).
- **Further improvements needed** in predicting COVID-positive patients.

## Future Scope & Enhancements (Pending Work)

I'll be working on the following improvements if I get time from my hell lot of projects. If someone is interested in collaborating, feel free to contact me!

- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Use **SMOTE** or **class weighting** to improve minority class predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional transformations.
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with **XGBoost, Random Forest, or Neural Networks**.
